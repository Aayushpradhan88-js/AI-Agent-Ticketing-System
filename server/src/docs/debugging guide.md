## **FULL-STACK DEVELOPER DEBUGGING MINDSET**
When working alone as a full-stack developer, follow this systematic approach:

### 🔍 **1. SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING LAYERS**
```
Frontend → Network → Backend → Database → Environment
```

### 🧠 **2. FULL-STACK THINKING PROCESS**
#### **A. Frontend Layer Check**
- ✅ Is token stored correctly?
- ✅ Is token being sent in headers?
- ✅ Are request headers correct?
- ✅ Is API URL correct?

#### **B. Network Layer Check**  
- ✅ Check browser DevTools Network tab
- ✅ Verify request/response status codes
- ✅ Check request headers being sent
- ✅ Verify response headers received

#### **C. Backend Layer Check**
- ✅ Check authentication middleware
- ✅ Verify JWT secret configuration
- ✅ Check route permissions
- ✅ Verify controller logic
- ✅ Check database queries

#### **D. Database Layer Check**
- ✅ Verify user exists
- ✅ Check user permissions/roles
- ✅ Validate data structure

#### **E. Environment Layer Check**
- ✅ Check .env variables
- ✅ Verify API endpoints
- ✅ Confirm database connections

## **FULL-STACK DEBUGGING MINDSET SUMMARY**

### **🧠 THINK LIKE A DETECTIVE**
1. **Start with symptoms** → What exactly is failing?
2. **Form hypotheses** → What could cause this?
3. **Test systematically** → Eliminate possibilities one by one
4. **Log everything** → Make the invisible visible
5. **Fix root cause** → Don't just patch symptoms

### **⚡ DEBUGGING EFFICIENCY TIPS**
- **Use console.log liberally** during development
- **Check both frontend AND backend logs** simultaneously  
- **Use browser DevTools** as your best friend
- **Test incrementally** after each fix
- **Document your findings** for future reference

### **🔄 ITERATIVE PROCESS**
```
Identify Issue → Form Hypothesis → Test → Analyze Results → Repeat
```

The key to full-stack debugging is **systematic investigation across all layers** and **not assuming where the problem lies**. Always verify your assumptions with data!
